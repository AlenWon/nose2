- need a log-level command line arg for doing basic logging config,
  in the absence of logcapture

- order of events in loading from test cases prevents other plugins
  from excluding test cases from being loaded by generator
  plugin. can it work like params plugin?

- generators and params plugins should also be able to load from
  non-testcase subclasses, how is that going to work?

- unclear how to make it possible for plugins to set wasSuccessful in
  concert with each other. Need another flag probably, beside
  event.success and event.handled.
